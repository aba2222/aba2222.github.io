The `gprof` is a performance analysis tool from GNU. And it is easy to use.

It just needs insert `-pg` when compiler.

```bash
gcc -pg -o a_program a_program.c
```

When it has run. It while generate a file named `gmon.out`. It need to be a text file.

```bash
gprof a_program gmon.out > analysis.txt
```

Then open the `analysis.txt`,  it will look like it:

```text
Flat profile:

Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
  %   cumulative   self              self     total           
 time   seconds   seconds    calls   s/call   s/call  name    
 50.16     19.85    19.85 413822162     0.00     0.00  possible_destination(int (*) [9], int, int)
 12.28     24.71     4.86        1     4.86    37.71  alpha_beta_search(int (*) [9], int, bool, float, float)
  9.10     28.31     3.60 72230986     0.00     0.00  valid_coordinate(int (*) [9], bool)
```

You can analysis where should improve in your program.
